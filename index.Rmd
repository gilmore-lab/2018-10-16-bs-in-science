## Overview

- A temperature-check
- Science and sin
- BS: Beyond sin

# A temperature check...

## What proportion of studies in the published scientific literature are *actually true*?

- 100%
- 90%
- 70%
- 50%
- 30%

## How do we define what '*actually true*' means?

## Science (and scientists) should be open & transparent about their methods and findings

### Agree | Disagree

## Science (and scientists) *should* be more open & transparent than they are now

### Agree | Disagree

## Openness and transparency are related to research robustness (e.g., reproducibility, reliability, impact)

### Agree | Disagree

## Unless there are privacy or contractual limitations, procedures and data files described in published scientific papers should be readily available in forms reusable by others

### Agree | Disagree

## Is there a reproducibility crisis in science?

>- Yes, a significant crisis
>- Yes, a slight crisis
>- No crisis
>- Don't know

- Enough details about materials & methods recorded (& reported)
- Same results with same materials & methods

## Reproducibility crisis

- Not just psychology and related behavioral sciences
- "Hard" sciences, too
- Data collection to statistical analysis to reporting to publishing

<div class="notes">
Clearly, the significant or slight crisis in reproducibility extends across scientific domains. 
Indeed, the NPR science reporter Richard Harris in a book published earlier this year said that sloppy biomedical research creates worthless cures, crushes hope, costs billions.
But rather than cast aspersions on other fields, let me own the sins of my own.
</div>

## So, is science 'full of it'?

<!-- Stepping over bs be like -->
- BS persuades, but disregards truth (Frankfurt, [*On Bullshit*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit))
- Science practices and communications attempt to persuade about the truth
- But if truth value disregarded, overlooked, downplayed, exaggerated...

But rather than cast aspersions on other fields, let me focus on my own field's deadly sins, as cognitive neuroscientist Chris Chambers put it.
</div>

</div>

<div class="notes">
As Szucs and Ioannides have shown based on an analysis of more than 10,000 papers in the cognitive neuroscience literature, sample sizes are small, and the probability of false negatives is high, especially for small to medium effect sizes.
</div>

> "Assuming a realistic range of prior probabilities for null hypotheses, false report probability is likely to exceed 50% for the whole literature."

## The sin of bias...

Bem, D.J. (2011). Experimental evidence for anomalous retroactive influences on cognition and affect. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, *100*(3), 407-425.

> "This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by "time-reversing" well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur."

<div class="notes">
And this 2011 paper by Daryl Bem from Cornell purporting to show evidence for Extrasensory Perception or precognition. Psychology is harder than physics, but it doesn't supercede it. This paper as blogger Tal Yarkoni [notes](http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2011/01/10/the-psychology-of-parapsychology-or-why-good-researchers-publishing-good-articles-in-good-journals-can-still-get-it-totally-wrong/) shows the perils of using standard, but flawed research practices.

</div>

<div class="notes">
Yes, Bem was arguing for some sort of "Minority Report"-like evidence for precognition or ESP.
</div>
---

> "We argue that in order to convince a skeptical audience of a controversial claim, one needs to conduct strictly confirmatory studies and analyze the results with statistical tests that are conservative rather than liberal. We conclude that Bem's *p* values do not indicate evidence in favor of precognition; instead, they indicate that experimental psychologists need to change the way they conduct their experiments and analyze their data."

<small>([Wagenmakers et al., 2011](http://doi.org/10.1037/a0022790))</small>

<div class="notes">
But a careful, post-publication re-evaluation showed that Bem had made a number of small, defensible given current practices, errors that accumulated across his paper. None of them were picked up in review.

## Reproducibility in psychological science

- Bigger samples
- Multiple replications
- Registration
- Data, procedure, and materials sharing
- "Data blinding"
- Larg(er)-scale replication studies

> "We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available....The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P < .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects."

Karen Adolph at NYU is my partner in founding and directing the Databrary project. We have argued that video plays a central role in improving reproducibility in behavioural science. It has uniquely powerful abilities to capture who said or did what when and in what context.

## Improved statistical practices

- Automated checking of paper statistics (in American Psychological Association formats) via [Statcheck](http://statcheck.io)
- Redefine "statistical significance" as $p<.005$? [(Benjamin et al., 2017)](https://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/MKY9J)
- Or move away from [NHST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) toward more robust and cumulative practices (Bayesian, CI/effect-size-driven) 

## Store data, materials, code in repositories

- Data libraries
- Funder, journal mandates for sharing increasing
- But no long-term, stable, funding sources for curation, archiving, sharing
- ArXiv model
    - Institutional (Cornell) support
    - Subscription
